# Password Strength Checker and Password Generator

## Project Details
This project, **Password Strength Checker and Password Generator**, is a Python-based web application built using **Streamlit** and **uv**. It allows users to:
- Check the strength of a given password based on security metrics.
- Generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.

## Project Initialization
To start the project, run the following command:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Installation Guide
Before running the project, install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-checker.git
cd password-strength-checker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7+ recommended). Then, install the required packages:
```sh
pip install uv streamlit
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using **uv**, install dependencies with:
```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Built-in Python Libraries Used
- **random** - To generate random characters for passwords.
- **string** - To access predefined sets of characters like uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.

## Functionality
- **Password Strength Checker**: Analyzes the strength of user-input passwords based on length, complexity, and entropy.
- **Password Generator**: Creates secure passwords based on user preferences (length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and interactive UI using **Streamlit**.

## How to Run the Project
Once dependencies are installed, run:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the application in your default web browser.
